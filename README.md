# Neovim 
This projects seeks to arrange and align different neovim editor plugins together to provide a _fast, seamless and feature-rich_ **IDE(Integrated Development Environment), for Design Verification**.

## Introduction:
_**Neovim is a hyperextensible Vim-based text editor that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim.**_

What makes it stand out is the extensive support it provides for <i>[third party plugins](https://github.com/topics/neovim-plugins)</i>. And it does so with the help of [Lua scripts](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html).
This project consists of a custom configuration of NeoVim based on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) and contains LSP (Language Server Protocol) configuration files in compliance with the [best coding practices](https://github.com/muneebullashariff/best_coding_practices) for Design Verification. It contains all the features provided LazyVim and more.

## Features:
### LazyVim:

Since this project makes use of LazyVim, it packs all the features provided by the same. <br>

### Custom features:
* 📜 [Alpha-nvim](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim): Alpha provides nvim with a customized main menu page.

*  📂 [Pretty-fold](https://github.com/anuvyklack/pretty-fold.nvim) & [Fold-preview](https://github.com/anuvyklack/fold-preview.nvim):<br>
Pretty-fold supports foldtext customization.<img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/135f5bb3-3130-4024-b5e8-1f79f633dc50"> <p align = "center">_Without pretty-fold_ </p> <br><img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/61a20a6c-0396-4209-8317-51bf8e342fb4"> <p align = "center"> _With pretty-fold_ </p> <br>
Fold-preview allows you to preview closed folds, without opening them. <br> **How-to-use:** Click ``h`` on a fold to preview. <img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/cfbd1db4-01f9-4867-a795-45d493993581">
* </> [Nvterm](https://github.com/NvChad/nvterm): Nvterm provides easy access to the terminal within nvim. This can act like a console for compiling and reviewing code side-by-side. It also works great with the leap plugin, making it considerably easier and faster to find keywords for a given console output. <br> Note: The working directory of the terminal will match the working directory at which nvim was called. _For example, if Nvim was called at ``Downloads`` the working directory of the terminal inside Nvim will also be ``Downloads``._ <br> **How-to-use:** <br>
``Esc`` takes you to normal mode. ``i`` takes you to terminal mode. <br>
``Alt+h`` for a horizontal terminal. <img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/42ddd51e-e2a0-4237-8a9b-c5e261a08b3e"> <br>
``Alt+v`` for a vertical terminal. <img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/77dec970-229e-4558-9fe2-b514de6d0849"> <br>
``Alt+f`` for a floating terminal. <img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/cf2c0e94-8c15-4e1c-a904-ab60eabaa131">
* 🛢️[Oil](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim): Oil is a file-explorer that lets you edit your filesystem like a normal Neovim-buffer. <br> **How-to-use:** <br> ``-`` to initialize Oil and/or to go to parent working directory of the file. <br> ``Ctrl+s`` for a vertical split. <br> ``Ctrl+h`` for a horizontal split. <br> ``Ctrl+p`` to preview a file. <br> ``Ctrl+l`` to refresh Oil. <br> ``gx`` to open the chosen file in an external app. <br> ``g.`` to show hidden files. <br> <img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/58871458-1a4b-41e2-ae41-d10c88e8ef50">
* 🎨 Themes: An extensive list of common themes are made available. <br> **How-to-use:** ``Space`` ``u`` ``C`` to preview themes. <img src = "https://github.com/Myron2812/nvim-installer/assets/67193041/ecdbfa9a-5ebc-43e3-9e4c-66b6b0ebd90c"> <br> **Theme can be changed permanently in ``themes.lua`` which can be accessed from ``config`` from the main menu.**
